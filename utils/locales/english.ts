    'ProppU pricing for company users consists of two parts: a monthly subscription fee of 29 € per user and a 4% transaction fee from sold services. For example, if you have three employees in your company using the service and your monthly sales add up to 10 000€, ProppU charges 400€ transaction fee and 3*29€ for the subscription fee per user. We always offer a one month free trial period. ',

    'The use of ProppU costs 29€ per month per user. With this subscription price you can post as many listings on the marketplace as you like. We always offer a one month free trial period. During this free trial, you can also post a listing on the marketplace. If you do not wish to continue the use of the service after the free trial, your marketplace listing will be removed.',

  descriptionFive:
    'Once you receive an offer from another user, you will get notified via email. You can then view the offer in the app and accept or decline it. If you accept, you can request the seller to send a binding contract. You can always decline an offer in case it is not suitable for you. In both cases you can use the messaging tool to communicate with the buyer or seller, to request a new offer or amend an already sent one. Before an offer turns into a contract, it is not binding. ',
  titleSix: 'If I accept a bid on my listing, is it a binding contract ?',

    'As a company you can have one “super user” account under which you manage multiple resources. However if you need to send notifications to many different parties it is useful to have one license per employee. For example, if you want your employees to log in their working hours, report after certain project tasks are done, or complete other activity specifically related to their own actions, you should create a user profile for each.',
